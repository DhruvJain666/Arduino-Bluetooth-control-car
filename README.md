# **Arduino Bluetooth control car using L293D Motor Driver**
Today in this README.md we are going to Make DIY **Arduino Bluetooth control car** with **Arduino UNO R3, L293D Motor Driver, and HC-05 Bluetooth Module.** Here you will get Fully Detailed instructions for making **Arduino Bluetooth Controlled Car.** Codes are also Included.

## **How Arduino Bluetooth Controlled Car Works?**
This is a simple Micro-controller based car. The Micro-Controller is connected in the car. The Arduino is doing all this job. For receiving data wirelessly we are using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

At first, We have to connect/ pair the Bluetooth module with the phone (Android) you want to control. Now, we are doing different operations such as when we press the forward button then the Phone sends a data value to Bluetooth module.

Next, we have to code in a way that if Arduino Gets a Certain Data (Suppose ‘F’ for forwarding) we have to make a certain condition for running the car in a certain direction. So, basically there are many switch cases in the Arduino code. For a known condition or a switch case, the car will perform the added functions in the code.

In the Same way,**F, B, L, R are used for moving the car Forward, Backward, Left, Right movement.**
